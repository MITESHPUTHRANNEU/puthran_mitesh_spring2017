The data for the project analysis were downloaded from the following sites:
* Vehicle collision dataset has been downloaded from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) using **Socrata Open Data API** - **API Request**
* Weather dataset was downloaded from [NOAA Weather Data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND) where we have to enter the date range and the type of the data we need. The processing of the data takes 2-3 days depending on the type and size of data you are requesting - **CSV File**
