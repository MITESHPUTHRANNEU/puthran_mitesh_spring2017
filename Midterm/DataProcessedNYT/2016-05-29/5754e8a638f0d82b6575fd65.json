Rosemary, 81, raised three children on her own while managing a prominent career in advertising, political consulting, and later, as an advisor/guru/metaphysician to far too many to mention here. You know who you are. Along the way she met the wholehearted love of her life and was the bond that turned two very different families into one big, wonderful -- occasionally chaotic, but always interesting, famiglia. She is survived by her husband Tony, brother Richard, five children -- Chris and Ethan Eichrodt, Ashley O'Keeffe, and Chris and Adam Isidore -- and ten stunning grandchildren -- Alec, Eleanor, Holly, Allison, Griffin, Nico, Sophia, Charlotte, Olivia and Katrina.
