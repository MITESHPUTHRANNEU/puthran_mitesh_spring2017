Some of the photographs were used for propaganda purposes during the war to give the impression that the men, women and children were doing well in the camps. In recent decades some images, mostly by Dorothea Lange, have been published. But most of the 7,000 images in the National Archives and the Library of Congress were seldom seen until recently.", "pub_date": "2017-02-23T10:00:32+0000", "document_type": "blogpost", "source": "The New York Times", "snippet": "A new book documents the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II through images by Dorothea Lange and others, including Hikaru Iwasaki, who had been sent to a camp....", "multimedia": [], "web_url": "https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/a-lesson-from-the-1940s-america-is-capable-of-being-un-american/", "slideshow_credits": null, "blog": [], "_id": "58aee8517c459f2525d1e13c", "headline": {"main": "A Lesson From the 1940s: \u2018America Is Capable of Being Un-American\u2019", "kicker": "Lens"}}
