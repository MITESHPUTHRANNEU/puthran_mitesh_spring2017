The photo was taken in December during a routine assignment at a photo exhibition that Burhan Ozbilici, an Associated Press photographer, decided to attend at the last moment simply because it was on his way home. He arrived during Ambassador Andrey G. Karlov\u2019s speech, and within moments a 22-year-old off-duty police officer, Mevlut Mert Altintas, opened fire. Although Mr. Ozbilici was no more than 15 feet from the gunman, he did not run.", "pub_date": "2017-02-13T10:30:04+0000", "document_type": "blogpost", "source": "The New York Times", "snippet": "The top prize in this year\u2019s World Press Photo contest was given to a dramatic image of the assassination of Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey....", "multimedia": [], "web_url": "https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/the-worlds-best-photo-world-press-awards/", "slideshow_credits": null, "blog": [], "_id": "58a18b7a7c459f2525d1c052", "headline": {"main": "The World\u2019s Best Photo?", "kicker": "Lens"}}
