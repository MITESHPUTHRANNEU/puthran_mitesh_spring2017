A resident of Wellesley, MA, she was the daughter of the late William D. and Ruby Jordan McCoy, ever dear to them and her survivors, which are her two sisters, niece, nephews, brother-in-law, sister-in-law and extended family, and three stepdaughters. They have known a beautiful woman of loving warmth with an utter devotion to family, and a soaring intelligence. Known to many as Jo, she was an avid reader and much enjoyed music, particularly classical, and political discussions. After graduating from Dana Hall School, her work career began at the switchboard of a Boston financial company, followed by many years at Vance Sanders, and in time, for its general counsel, Arthur Hausserman. Later, a marriage brought great happiness to them both. She was predeceased by her husband and her brother. A service will be held Thursday, February 4, at 11am, Newton Cemetery Chapel, 791 Walnut Street, Newton Center, MA. Her family suggests contributions in Joanne's name to the charity of your choice, but requests no flowers. 1/3", "pub_date": "2016-01-29T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "slideshow_credits": null, "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  HAUSSERMANN, JOANNE MCCOY"}, "snippet": "HAUSSERMANN--Joanne McCoy, has died at age 85 on January 25, 2016, in East Providence, RI.
