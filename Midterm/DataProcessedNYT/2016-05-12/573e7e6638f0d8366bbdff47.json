The Board of Trustees and staff of Madison Square Park Conservancy mourn the passing of our public art program's visionary and long-time member of Mad. Sq. Art's Art Committee. Martin played a pivotal role in the creation and shaping of Mad. Sq. Art and his guidance and leadership were critical to defining and executing our mission. He was an innovative museum director, friend and champion of artists, fierce advocate for public art, and a man who lived an extraordinary life. He challenged us to push the boundaries of public art, to commission and show thought-provoking and groundbreaking original sculpture by world class contemporary artists in historic Madison Square Park. His impact on artists was legendary and his clarity of purpose stretched to this art program with remarkable foresight for how public sculpture can impact people and serve as a catalyst for an artist's breakthrough. It was our great honor to have been the beneficiary of his great gift as a teacher and a friend. We extend our sympathies to his family.
