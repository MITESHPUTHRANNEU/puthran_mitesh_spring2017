# Question 1 Analysis

## Part 1
### I found out top 20 persons in Enron who recieved the most emails and their number from everyone in the company by traversing through the whole dataset. This helps to find out who were most active n the organization.
###Using this data I exported it to CSV file and plotted its respective loglog graph

## Part 2
### One of the biggest culprit of Enron downfall was Jeffery Skilling, so I found out top 10 persons in the organization to whom he has sent the mail by using his sent mail folder and the results include the top culprits responsible.

## Part 3
### I calculated the average words in a mail that was ever sent by Jeffery Skilling using his sent mail directory
